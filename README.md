# R_DataVisualizations
This is an R Markdown Notebook dedicated to the introduction of data visualizations in R. Similar to the Python Data Visualization Jupyter Notebook on my Github, I will be using the same NYC OpenData file and running similar visuals. Specifically, I be utilizing ggplot2 to create data visualizations and will also be using the tidyverse package to run data wrangling packages, notably dplyr.
